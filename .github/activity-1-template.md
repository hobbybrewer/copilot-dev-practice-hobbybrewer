Welcome to the team. You are the new team member to this business project. You have been in the Company for few years, but have just shifted to this project. You understand the MERN stack, and have worked few production projects in the past.

We have a low / non-critical severity fix come in from one of the Business Owners of the project, and it is being tracked on our Project Board. As you know we are low on staff due to vacations in the team, and we need you to pick up this requirement and start working on it. This being a non-critical fix, and it will help you get familiar with the project and the code base.
