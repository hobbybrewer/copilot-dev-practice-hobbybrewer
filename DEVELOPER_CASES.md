Welcome to the team. You are the new team member to this business project. You have been in the Company for few years, but have just shifted to this project. You understand the MERN stack, and have worked few production projects in the past.

We have a low / non-critical severity fix come in from one of the Business Owners of the project, and it is being tracked on our Project Board. As you know we are low on staff due to vacations in the team, and we need you to pick up this requirement and start working on it. This being a non-critical fix, and it will help you get familiar with the project and the code base.

<h3 align="left">Case 2: Developer experienced on the Project - New Feature / Requirement</h3>

Hi, It is exciting to be working again with you on this new requirements. This is High Severity requirement, and we need to get this done in this Quarter. This requirement can improve the client experience and help them to see their listings in their geographical location.

<h4 align="left">New Feature / Requirement: Geo Location based displaying listings</h4>
Our Sales employees log in from different locations across the globe. They have clients, partners, vendors and franchise owners visiting their locations quite often. Today they access the Accomodation page and need to manually find different listings specific to their location. We would like you and your team to build a solution which displays only their listings based on their Geo Location. We have partnered with a Geo Location service in the past, and would request you to use the same location to build a working prototype. Our website is protected by the leading Content Delivery Network(CDN) and you could use their features for building your solution.  

Our Sister Company is using [IP2LOCATION](https://www.ip2location.com/) and for this prototype we would like you to use the same service.
