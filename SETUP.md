To ensure the best experience during this workshop, please follow the steps in this instruction to get your environment up

## Configure Codespaces

[GitHub Codepsaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) is a development environment that's hosted in the cloud. It supports customisation by configuring dev container for your repository, to define a choice of different development environments that are appropriate for the work people will do in your repo.

### :wrench: Create your own Codespace instance

Inside your personal workshop repo(NOT the repo template your create this repo from), find `Code`, Select `Codespaces Tab`, then click the `+` to create a new Codespace instance. A new Tab will prompt and you should start seeing progress in Codespace preparation.

ℹ️ It generally takes a few minutes to get your Codespace ready for use <br />
ℹ️ Although GitHub Codespaces supports a variety of IDE enginee, we will be using Visual Studio Code in this workshop(which is also the default choice)<br />
ℹ️ Every Codespaces instance comes with a name randomly selected by GitHub during creation<br />

### :question: What if I accidentally closed Codespace tab?

If you closed the Codespace tab in your browser, you can always resume it. On your repo main page, locate recent Codespace instance via `Code` -> `Codespace Tab`, click the instance name will pop up the Codespace environment.

### :mag: Check out Copilot for CLI

Just like local VS Code, Codespaces also comes with terminal for command inputs. In this repository we already installed Copilot for CLI. Try type something starting with `??`, for example, `?? list file`. Copilot for CLI will return command suggestion. Feel free to accept or cancel using your keyboard arrows.
