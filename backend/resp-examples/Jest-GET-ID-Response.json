You are steps to Central Park and to the 86th subway.  There are wonderful restaurants and shopping nearby if you need that but the small kitchen is fine for quick snacks and breakfast.  It was especially nice to sit on the little patio to eat my toast and tea and even with the NYC humming around you it is lovely to have an outdoor space.  Chas answered all my many questions with great patience and care...he really wanted us to have a wonderful time and went beyond the call of duty by even sending us links to good places to watch big soccer matches.  The apartment was clean when we arrived and had the basic things we needed such as towels and extra sheets.  While not the cheapest option on BNB it gave us all a wonderful bed to sleep in, space to spread out in when needed, and a fantastic location!  We even found street parking for the full 5 days!  Picking up the keys was a breeze and we left a few basic things for the next guests to enjoy from the corner store.   It is a gorgeous street to stay on and felt very safe. Thank you so much Chas!  We hope to return one day soon."

The location is perfect particularly for those wanting access to Central Park and the museum mile (Guggenheim etc) but it was also a revelation to explore that end of Broadway.  The apartment is lovely and has everything.  We especially appreciated the study nook and ability to use our laptop with wifi access and the well equipped kitchen for easy prep for meals (and deli close by makes it so easy to stock up).  The lounge, bedroom and bathroom are all in good, comfortable condition.  The little balconies and view of the courtyard topped it off.  A great experience and thoroughly recommend."

There are so many details -- from the art on the walls to the spices in the kitchen -- that make it feel like a home away from home. The apartment is small but imminently comfortable with high ceilings and patios that make it feel spacious. The unit is off the street (on a courtyard)  so it was very quiet (that  and the comfortable bed made for great nights of sleeping). It's a beautiful street, just off Central Park and just around the corner from the subway. There are abundant restaurants within a 5 minute walk and the best coffee in NY (Joe's) is only about two blocks away. Chas was a great host who was quick to answer all our questions and make our stay as enjoyable as possible. We had our two sons with us (ages 10 and 12) and the living arrangements were ideal for a family our size. Thanks, Chas!"

The apartment was so nice, quiet, comfortable, and cool to come back to after being out and about ( we had a couple of days during our stay where it was very warm ) and that was a plus !

Both Chas and Paul were quick at answering emails and provided us with plenty of information re local grocery shops etc. The pick-up of the keys was also very simple. \r\nThe apartment is in a great location, half a block from Central Park and close to several subway lines. Only up one flight of stairs, which was good because there are no lifts! \r\nThe apartment was very well equipped with everything you need for a stay away from home - bedding, towels, full kitchen etc. It was a bit smaller than it appears in the photos and could do with a lick of paint, but was very clean and had plenty of storage. Also, keep in mind that the beds in the loft may provide a bit of a problem for some guests - definitely best for kids. \r\nOverall, we had a great time at Chas' apartment and would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting to visit New York!

The neighborhood was cosy and felt safe, the subway was only steps away and it was close both to the park and to the shops and restaurants on Amsterdam and Broadway. It couldn't have been better. The apartment itself was nice and roomy for being in New York, and had everything we needed. The kitchen was small but well equipped and the beds were comfortable. Chas was very helpful and answered all our questions very quickly. Overall, it was a really wonderful stay!"

The mezzanine floor is best suited for storage or sleeping arrangements for children or understanding teens or adults.\r\nThe upper West Side felt very safe at all times and the apartment was on the same block for the subway stops for B and C trains and a short walk to restaurants / cafes on Columbus and Amsterdam.  Overall, the apartment offered a genuine feeling of how it would be to live as a New Yorker, rather than a hotel tourist.  Highly recommended."

The first floor does have a low ceiling which is ideal for smaller children. The apartment was always warm so it was a treat to come back home after a long day out in the cold. Would definitely consider staying here again."

The heating is excellent and the building is very quiet with almost no ambient noise whatsoever; again, a rarity in New York. The apartment is located in a beautiful street lined with old Brownstones, so would be perfect for those who prefer a genteel New York neighbourhood rather than an urban, grungy one. It is located a few minutes' walk from the subway and a block back from Central Park. Great spot, and the owners were easy to arrange accommodation with."

It is in a quiet residential building on a lovely tree lined lock on the upper west side; close to the subway and next to  Central Park. If you walk to Columbus Avenue, there are stores and restaurants and also on Amsterdam Avenue and Broadway. Its a great place to stay if you want to enjoy NYC and then come back to a quiet and tranquil retreat. Our host was very communicate regarding the arrangements for acquiring the apartment keys and any questions we had were answered promptly. There is a laundry in the basement of the building which makes it easy to wash and dry your clothes. The Museum of Natural History is close by and so is the NY Historical Society and of course beautiful Central Park and one can walk towards the  Henry Hudson River to Riverside Park.  Overall a lovely and positive experience. Thank you!"

The flat was the perfect cosy place to come back to and watch the snow.

Very happy to be so close to the subway which made going downtown very easy. \n\nWe were a couple and extra adult, who slept in the loft. It is a loft (can't stand up) but nice to sleep on a real mattress,  as opposed to fold out sofas like much of the value for money accommodation in New York. \n\nChas was easy to communicate with, and very accommodating as we were able to arrange for us to drop our bags off early before check in so that we could head off and explore. Would stay again in the future, as such great value for money (and doesn't feel like your staying a shoe box, like most of NYC). Would be perfect for families. Thanks! "

Riverside park is just a few blocks in the other direction. \nUWS is a great place to stay in the city. I've stayed in UES and Harlem before. UWS and UES is about the same, but this location at UWS is quieter. \n\nFor great restaurants just walk on over to Columbus Av, Amsterdam Av or Broadway and your set. \n\nThe apartment: It was nice, big and homely. The bushes by the little veranda could use some trimming but we didn't have time to use it anyway. \nAC is really good. You leave it off when you go out. Put it on when you get back in and it's nice, and cool in minutes. \nAs indicated, the ceiling in the loft is low. You can't stand up straight. But there's plenty of room up there. \n\nCommunicating with Chas was easy. He always answered my questions quickly. \n\nOverall a great experience! "

The apartment looks as it appears in the pictures and has all the amenities you would want to have a comfortable stay.  The location is fantastic as the street is quiet, there is a subway stop right at your door and you are steps away from all sorts of great food and entertainment.  You could spend hours just exploring Central Park, which is right next door.  Thank you Chas for providing a home away from home in the best city in the world."
